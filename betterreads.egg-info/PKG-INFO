        This package provides a Python interface for the `Goodreads
        API <http://goodreads.com/api>`__. Using it, you can do pretty much
        anything that Goodreads allows through their public API.
        
        This package is largely Python 2 compatible, but is only officially supported for Python 3.
        
        Why BetterReads?
        ----------------
        
        BetterReads is an expansion of the goodreads2 package available on PyPi. That package is no longer maintained
        and needed some updates to be usable. The name is just cheeky and cute, and not to imply that this project is
        substantially better than any other project. Someday I hope it's succeeded by a Python package called BestReads.
        
        Major updates in this new project:
        
        - Use https for Oauth - goodreads now requires this and previous packages' Oauth requests always fail
        - Add convenience method to get all of a user's reviews for a specific shelf
        - Some opinionated development changes. For example
           - No longer making live API calls in unit tests
           - Using `black code style <https://github.com/ambv/black>`__ across the board
           - More robust `documentation <https://betterreads.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        This package depends on the following packages:
        
        -  xmltodict
        -  requests
        -  rauth
        -  backports-datetime-fromisoformat
        
        They can be installed using ``pip``.
        
        ::
        
            sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        If you want to contribute to this package, you will need to install the packages
        in ``requirements-dev.txt`` as well.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install, run the following command from the top-level package
        directory.
        
        ::
        
            sudo python setup.py install
        
        You can also install BetterReads using pip. The current version on PyPi is 0.4.1.
        
        ::
        
            pip install betterreads
        
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        The first thing is to request an API key from Goodreads
        `here <https://www.goodreads.com/api/keys>`__. Once you have it, you can
        create a client instance to query Goodreads.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from betterreads import client
            gc = client.GoodreadsClient(<api_key>, <api_secret>)
        
        To access some of the methods, you need `OAuth <http://oauth.net/>`__
        for authorization.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            gc.authenticate(<access_token>, <access_token_secret>)
        
        Note that ``access_token`` and ``access_token_secret`` are different
        from developer key and secret. For the development step, you can call
        the same function with no parameters to get authorization. It will open
        a URL pointing a Goodreads page for OAuth permission. For your
        application, you can direct the user to that particular URL, ask them
        to authorize your app and save the returning ``access_token`` and
        ``access_token_secret`` in your database.
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        This package provides a Python interface for most Goodreads API methods.
        Here are a few examples demonstrating how to access data on Goodreads.
        
        Books
        ~~~~~
        
        Let's access the first book added to Goodreads! It is the book with id
        1.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            book = gc.book(1)
        
        Once you have the ``GoodreadsBook`` instance for the book, you can
        access data for the queried book.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> book.title
            u'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter, #6)'
            >>> authors = book.authors
            >>> authors[0].name
            u'J.K. Rowling'
            >>> book.average_rating
            u'4.49'
        
        Authors
        ~~~~~~~
        
        You can get information about an author as well.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> author = gc.author(2617)
            >>> author.name
            u'Jonathan Safran Foer'
            >>> author.works_count
            u'13'
            >>> author.books
            [Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, Everything Is Illuminated, Eating Animals, Tree of Codes, Everything is Illuminated & Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, The unabridged pocketbook of lightning, The Future Dictionary of America, A Convergence of Birds: Original Fiction and Poetry Inspired by Joseph Cornell, New American Haggadah, The Sixth Borough]
        
        Users
        ~~~~~
        
        User data can be retrieved by user id or username.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> user = gc.user(1)
            >>> user.name
            u'Otis Chandler'
            >>> user.user_name
            u'otis'
            >>> user.small_image_url
            u'http://d.gr-assets.com/users/1189644957p2/1.jpg'
        
        Groups
        ~~~~~~
        
        Let's find a group discussing Python and get more information about it.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> g = gc.find_groups("Python")
            >>> g = groups[0]
            >>> g['title']
            u'The Computer Scientists'
            >>> group = gc.group(g['id'])
            >>> group.description
            u'Only for Committed Self Learners and Computer Scientists Who are Starving for
            Information, and Want to Advance their Skills Through: Reading, Practicing and
            Discussion Computer Science and Programming Books.'
        
        Events
        ~~~~~~
        
        Goodreads API also allows to list events happening in an area.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> events = gc.list_events(21229)
            >>> event = events[0]
            >>> event.title
            u'Books and Cocktails'
            >>> event.address
            u'120 N. Front St.'
            >>> event.city
            u'Wrightsville'
